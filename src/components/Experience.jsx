              React Native Mobile App Developer - 3-Month Internship
            </h3>
            <p className="py-2">
              During my internship at a startup, I took the lead on developing a
              full-featured mobile application using React Native, backed by
              Node.js, Express, Firebase, and TypeScript. The app integrates
              Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to connect wristbands and manage devices. Some
              of the key features and technologies I implemented include:

              <li>
                <span>
                  Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication,
                  generating tokens to manage user login sessions and protect
                  API endpoints.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  Built a user-friendly multi-device management feature that
                  allows users to pair and manage multiple wristbands using
                  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  Designed a multi-step onboarding process for setting up
                  wristbands, ensuring a smooth experience for users.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  Integrated Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync data
                  across devices, ensuring real-time updates and seamless
                  performance.
                </span>

              <li>
                <span>
                  Utilized TypeScript to maintain clean, strongly-typed code and
                  improve scalability across both the frontend and backend.
